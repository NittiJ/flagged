Add this after your Custom_Thresholds <- read.xlsx(...) and before the email logic:

# Validate that all network names have thresholds
unmatched_networks <- setdiff(
  names(network_match_list),
  Custom_Thresholds$Alpha_Network_Name
)

if (length(unmatched_networks) > 0) {
  warning("The following networks in network_match_list were not found in the threshold Excel and will use default threshold:\n",
          paste(unmatched_networks, collapse = "\n"))
}



  üîç What this does:
Compares your actual run networks (network_match_list keys)

Against what's defined in the threshold Excel (Alpha_Network_Name)

Outputs a warning for each one not found ‚Äî useful for catching:

Misspellings

Missing "blend" variants

New networks not yet added to Excel





  Create the admin message:




  admin_notice <- ""
if (length(unmatched_networks) > 0) {
  admin_notice <- paste0(
    "<br><br><hr><br>",
    "<em><strong>Admin Notice:</strong> The following networks were not found in the thresholds sheet and used the default value:</em><br><ul>",
    paste0("<li>", unmatched_networks, "</li>", collapse = ""),
    "</ul>"
  )
}




  Append to your bl_body like this:

r
Copy
Edit




  bl_body <- paste0(
  "This disruption was flagged due to low match rates in the following network(s):<br><br>",
  summary_lines,
  select_lines,
  "Original requestor:<br><strong>Email:</strong> ", Parameters$Values[3],
  admin_notice  # this only appears if something was unmatched
)
